## Try out the Generative AI models 

To compare two generative AI models using the GitHub Marketplace Models, follow these steps. For this example, the first model you will test is GPT-5:

1. Visit [GitHub Marketplace Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models/).
2. Click the model select button located at the top-left of the page.
3. Search for "GPT-5" and select it as your first model.
4. At the chat section, propmt the model with your desired input or question. 
5. Evaluate the output based on your criteria (e.g., accuracy, relevance, creativity).

## Compare with another model

6. On the top-left of the page, click the `compare` button again.
7. Select the `DeepSeek` model as your second generative AI model. (or other model you want to compare)
8. The chat section will now display both models side by side for comparison.
9. Choose the pre-defined input or question from the screen or enter your own input to see how each model responds.
10. Evaluate the outputs from both models based on your criteria.

For more details, refer to the official documentation of each model on the marketplace.
