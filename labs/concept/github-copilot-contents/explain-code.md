# Explain the code with Command Palett

1. Open the Spring Boot project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the file `NextflowBootApplication.java` in the package `th.in.nextflow.NextflowBoot`.
3. Use Command Palette **(Ctrl + Shift + P)** then search for `Copilot: Explain Code`.
4. You will see the Copilot chat side bar on the right side of the screen with explanation of the code.

    > **Tips:** if it is hard to understand, you can ask Copilot to explain the code again with prompt: `make it easy to understand by 10 years old kid`.
